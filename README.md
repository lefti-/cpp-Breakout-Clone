What?
-----
This repo contains a clone of Breakout. This is a game I'm developing as my second serious game project. 
The game is programmed in C++, using SFML and Box2D. NOTE: Still under development.

- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is used for handling input, graphics, audio, windowing and text
- Box2D is used for collision detection and response

Project:
---------
- Features gameplay well-known from Breakout
- Local highscores
- Graphics created in Paint.net
- Still under development

How to play?
