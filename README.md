Breakout Clone
----------
What?
-----
This repo contains a clone of Bong! This is a game I developed as my second serious game project. 
The game is programmed in C++, using SFML and Box2D.

- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is used for handling input, graphics, audio, windowing and text
- Box2D is used for collision detection and response

Project:
---------
- Features gameplay well-known from Breakout! 
- Local highscores
- Graphics created in Paint.net

How to play?
------------
Try to destroy all of the blocks to get to the next level!

TODO
----
Provide the compiled binaries
